Sports Theme for Subreddits
===========================

Features:

- Team colors set in HTML (perfect for throwback weeks)
- Easy to customize images and captions (upload image and edit text in theme)
- Season Scheudle
- Draft Schedule
- Flair options

User roles to consider:

- Unsubscribed
- Subscribed (submit button, should maybe be made top posts all time in subreddit)
- Moderators

Operations:

Ideally, we will have a setup where moderators only need to make quick changes on the sidebar to provide weekly updates.  Beyond that you have as much flexibility as provided by your moderators abilities with theming.
